The Odin Project - Todo List

A clean, modular todo list app built with modern JavaScript and CSS. Organize your tasks into projects, set priorities and keep track of due dates, all with persistent local storage.

## Features

- **Project Organization:** Group todos into separate projects.
- **Dynamic Todos:** Add, delete, and mark todos as complete.
- **Priority & Due Dates:** Set priority levels and due dates for each todo.
- **Persistent Storage:** All data is saved in your browser using localStorage.
- **Visual Priority:** Todos are color-coded by priority.
- **Modular Structure:** Logic and DOM code are separated for maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Edit Details:** Expand todos to view details (editing coming soon).

## How It Works

- View all projects and their todos.
- Add new projects and todos using the forms.
- Click a todo's checkbox to mark it complete.
- Click "Details" to view more info about a todo.
- Delete todos and projects as needed.
- All changes are saved automatically.
