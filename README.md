## The Odin Project - Todo List

A K.I.T.T. / Knight Rider inspired todo manager built with modern JavaScript and CSS. Tasks are organized into projects, with priorities, due dates and persistent local storage. The UI features a dynamic scanner bar, themed dashboard panels and compact mission-style todos.

### Features

- **Thematic K.I.T.T. UI:** Animated scanner, dashboard buttons and voice notification panel.
- **Project Organization:** Group todos into separate projects and rename/delete projects.
- **Compact Todos:** Each todo shows checkbox, title, two-line description, time remaining and action icons.
- **Priority & Due Dates:** Priority badges and timeline indicators with visual urgency.
- **Persistent Storage:** All data is saved locally in the browser using localStorage.
- **Modular Structure:** Separated modules for projects, todos, storage, DOM rendering and KITT voice manager.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile with a responsive layout.

### How It Works

- Use the left sidebar to switch between projects or add a new mission/project.
- Add new todos with title, description, due date and priority using the Add Todo form.
- The main panel shows mission stats and a compact list of todos; long lists are scrollable.
- Toggle dashboard modes (Turbo, Surveillance, Auto) to change the theme and scanner behavior.
- Click the pencil icon to edit a todo (modal) or the trash icon to delete it.
- All changes persist automatically in your browser.
